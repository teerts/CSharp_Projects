Feedback: 

1) Start function names with capitals and use CamelCase
2) Common functions should not be repeated
	- for example: the key inputs for 1-9 can use a switch statement instead of individual functions
3) Setting a global variable that is used everywhere is not a good idea - hard to backtrack
4) Controller does not use many partial classes
